For this project I decided to create my own from scratch instead of using the skeleton files provided. Unfortunately, due to time I was unable to add a scanner for the app to run in the console from a JAR exe file. 

FILE LOCATIONS

The classes and packages have been structed as the following:

DB set up connection and main runner - IMS-Starter\src\main\java\com\qa\ims\finalPrj\utils

Business Logic files/methods - IMS-Starter\src\main\java\com\qa\ims\finalPrj\businesslogic

Objects/domain files - IMS-Starter\src\main\java\com\qa\ims\finalPrj\domain

Controller files - IMS-Starter\src\main\java\com\qa\ims\finalPrj\controllers

JUnit testing - IMS-Starter\src\test\java\com\qa\ims\finalPrj\JUnit

Risk assessments and db models - IMS-Starter\Documents

HOW TO RUN THE APP

The application will have to be run from an IDE:

* Locate the main runner file named "Run" and from there you can uncomment the relevant lines of code to run the app
